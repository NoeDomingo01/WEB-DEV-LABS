      <h2>The History of Esports</h2>
      <p>
        Esports did not become a global phenomenon overnight. Its journey spans decades, beginning with small gaming competitions and evolving into stadium-sized events watched by millions of fans.
      </p>

      <h3>Early Beginnings (1970s–1980s)</h3>
      <p>
        The first recorded video game competition happened in 1972 at Stanford University, featuring the game <em>Spacewar!</em>. By the 1980s, arcade games like <em>Pac-Man</em> and <em>Donkey Kong</em> became popular for high-score competitions. Magazines and small local contests brought players together long before streaming and the internet.
      </p>

      <h3>The Rise of Online Gaming (1990s)</h3>
      <p>
        The 1990s introduced competitive gaming on PCs and consoles. Games like <em>Doom</em> and <em>Quake</em> inspired LAN parties and early online tournaments. Nintendo even hosted its own competitions through the <em>Nintendo World Championships</em>. South Korea played a huge role during this decade, popularizing professional gaming with <em>StarCraft</em>.
      </p>

      <h3>The 2000s: Esports Goes Global</h3>
      <p>
        The growth of the internet allowed esports to reach global audiences. Organizations like the World Cyber Games (WCG) and Major League Gaming (MLG) hosted international events. Popular titles like <em>Counter-Strike</em>, <em>Warcraft III</em>, and <em>Dota</em> built the foundations of modern esports culture.
      </p>

      <h3>Modern Era (2010s–Present)</h3>
      <p>
        Esports exploded in the 2010s with the rise of streaming platforms like Twitch and YouTube Gaming. Tournaments such as <em>The International</em> (Dota 2) and the <em>League of Legends World Championship</em> offered multi-million dollar prize pools. Esports is now a mainstream industry with official leagues, celebrity players, and international recognition.
