      <h2>About Esports</h2>
      <p>
        Esports, short for <em>electronic sports</em>, refers to organized competitive video gaming. It is not simply about playing for fun—it is a professional environment where teams and players compete in front of audiences, both online and offline. The rapid rise of esports has turned it into a billion-dollar industry with fans, sponsors, and international recognition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Esports covers a wide range of genres. Popular categories include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena):</strong> Games like Dota 2 and League of Legends where strategy and teamwork dominate.</li>
        <li><strong>FPS (First-Person Shooter):</strong> Tactical games like CS:GO and Valorant that test reflexes and precision.</li>
        <li><strong>Battle Royale:</strong> Survival-based games like Fortnite and PUBG with massive player counts.</li>
        <li><strong>Sports/Fighting Games:</strong> Titles like FIFA, NBA 2K, and Tekken recreate traditional sports and martial arts in a digital arena.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Today, esports tournaments rival traditional sporting events in scale. With millions of viewers worldwide, sponsorship deals, and professional organizations, esports has become a cultural movement that proves gaming is more than just entertainment—it’s a competitive and global industry.
