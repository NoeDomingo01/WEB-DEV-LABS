      <h2>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO)</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO)</strong> is a tactical first-person shooter developed by Valve and Hidden Path Entertainment, released in 2012. As the fourth game in the Counter-Strike series, CS:GO refined the formula of competitive team-based shooters and became a cornerstone of esports for over a decade.
      </p>

      <h3>Gameplay</h3>
      <p>
        CS:GO pits two teams — Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists — against each other in objective-based rounds. Popular modes include Bomb Defusal and Hostage Rescue. Players rely on precise aiming, strategic utility usage (smokes, flashes, grenades), and teamwork to win. The game’s simplicity combined with high skill ceiling makes it timeless.
      </p>

      <h3>Major Tournaments</h3>
      <p>
        CS:GO is famous for its <em>Major Championships</em>, organized by Valve and featuring the best teams worldwide. These tournaments attract millions of viewers and offer some of the most intense matches in esports history. Legendary players like s1mple, dev1ce, and FalleN have left their mark on the scene.
      </p>

      <h3>Esports Legacy</h3>
      <p>
        CS:GO built the foundation for modern competitive FPS games. Its balance, map design, and competitive integrity influenced titles like Valorant. Even after the release of Counter-Strike 2 in 2023, CS:GO remains respected as one of the greatest esports titles ever.
