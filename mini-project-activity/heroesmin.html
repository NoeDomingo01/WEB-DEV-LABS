      <h2>The Heroes of Dota 2</h2>
      <p>
        At the core of Dota 2 are its <strong>heroes</strong>—unique characters that define how the game is played. 
        With more than 120 heroes to choose from, each with distinct abilities, strengths, and weaknesses, players must 
        carefully select their heroes to build the perfect team composition. Heroes are divided into roles such as carries, supports, 
        initiators, and offlaners, each contributing to the team’s strategy in different ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        Popular heroes like <strong>Pudge</strong>, known for his iconic hook ability, and <strong>Invoker</strong>, a master of spellcasting, 
        have become legends in the community. Others, like <strong>Juggernaut</strong>, <strong>Crystal Maiden</strong>, and <strong>Earthshaker</strong>, 
        are staples of competitive play and fan favorites. The diversity of the hero roster ensures that no two matches are ever the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        Esports teams often prepare specific drafts and strategies built around certain heroes, making the drafting phase one of 
        the most exciting moments in professional games. Choosing the right hero at the right time can decide the outcome of a match. 
        This complexity is one of the reasons Dota 2 remains one of the most challenging and rewarding esports titles in the world.
