      <h2>The History of Dota 2</h2>
      <p>
        The story of <strong>Dota 2</strong> begins with the original <em>Defense of the Ancients</em> (DotA), a custom map created for 
        <em>Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos</em> and its expansion <em>The Frozen Throne</em>. The map, developed by the community, 
        quickly became one of the most popular mods in gaming history. It introduced the concept of a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA), 
        where teams of heroes fought in strategic battles to control the map and destroy the enemy base.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing its potential, Valve hired IceFrog, one of the lead developers of DotA, to create a standalone sequel. 
        This led to the release of Dota 2 in 2013 on Steam. Unlike the mod, Dota 2 was built on Valve’s Source engine, 
        which allowed for modern graphics, matchmaking, and continuous updates.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the beginning, Dota 2 embraced esports. Valve introduced <em>The International</em> in 2011, even before the game’s full release, 
        with an unprecedented prize pool of $1.6 million. This event set the tone for Dota 2 as one of the most competitive and 
        community-driven games ever. Over the years, <em>The International</em> became legendary, breaking records with prize pools 
        exceeding $40 million, all crowdfunded by players through the in-game Battle Pass.
