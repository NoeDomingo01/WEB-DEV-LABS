      <h2>Valorant</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Valorant</strong>, released by Riot Games in 2020, is a tactical first-person shooter (FPS) that blends
        precise gunplay with unique character abilities. Often compared to <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em> 
        for its round-based format, Valorant introduces <em>Agents</em>—characters with distinct skills that can turn
        the tide of battle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since its launch, Valorant has quickly become a major title in the esports world. Riot Games built upon 
        its success in <em>League of Legends</em> by creating the Valorant Champions Tour (VCT), a global competitive
        structure that culminates in the Valorant Champions event. With millions of viewers and massive sponsorships,
        Valorant has established itself as one of the premier esports.
