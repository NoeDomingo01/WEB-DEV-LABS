      <h2>Welcome to the World of Esports</h2>
      <p>
        Esports, short for “electronic sports,” has grown from a niche hobby into a global phenomenon. Millions of fans around the world watch professional players compete in games like <strong>Dota 2</strong>, <strong>League of Legends</strong>, <strong>Valorant</strong>, <strong>CS:GO</strong>, and <strong>Mobile Legends</strong>. These competitions are no longer just online matches—they fill arenas, stream to millions, and offer prize pools worth millions of dollars.

        What makes esports exciting is the combination of skill, strategy, and teamwork. Just like traditional sports, players train for years to master their mechanics and teamwork. Professional organizations, sponsors, and leagues support them, creating a thriving ecosystem where gamers can make a career out of their passion.
