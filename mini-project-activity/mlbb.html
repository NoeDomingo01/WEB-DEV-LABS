      <h2>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang (MLBB)</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang (MLBB)</strong> is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed by Moonton, first released in 2016. Designed specifically for mobile devices, MLBB has become one of the most popular mobile esports titles, especially in Southeast Asia.
      </p>

      <h3>Gameplay</h3>
      <p>
        Like other MOBAs, MLBB features two teams of five players competing to destroy the enemy base. Players choose from a wide roster of heroes, each with unique skills and roles, including tanks, mages, marksmen, assassins, and supports. Matches are fast-paced, usually lasting around 15 to 20 minutes, making it ideal for mobile gaming.
      </p>

      <h3>Esports Tournaments</h3>
      <p>
        MLBB has developed a thriving esports ecosystem, highlighted by the <em>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang Professional League (MPL)</em> and the <em>MLBB World Championship (M-Series)</em>. Countries like the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia dominate the scene, with teams such as Blacklist International, ONIC, and EVOS Legends gaining international recognition.
      </p>

      <h3>Global Impact</h3>
      <p>
        As one of the first truly successful mobile esports titles, MLBB has proven that mobile gaming can be just as competitive and entertaining as PC or console esports. Its accessibility, large player base, and exciting tournaments continue to push mobile esports to new heights.
