      <h2>Major Dota 2 Tournaments</h2>
      <p>
        Competitive <strong>Dota 2</strong> thrives on its tournaments, which showcase the best teams in the world and attract 
        millions of fans. The most famous of these is <em>The International</em> (TI), an annual championship organized by Valve. 
        First held in 2011, TI set a new standard for esports events by offering a massive $1.6 million prize pool. Since then, 
        it has grown into the largest esports tournament, with prize pools exceeding $40 million, funded by the community through 
        in-game purchases.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to TI, Valve also organizes the <strong>Dota Pro Circuit (DPC)</strong>, a seasonal league system where teams 
        compete across regions to earn points and qualify for The International. This ensures a highly competitive environment 
        throughout the year, keeping fans engaged and teams motivated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond Valveâ€™s events, there are many third-party tournaments hosted by organizations such as ESL, DreamHack, and 
        ONE Esports. These competitions not only give teams more opportunities to showcase their talent but also expand the 
        global reach of Dota 2. From local qualifiers to world-class finals, tournaments are at the heart of the Dota 2 esports experience.
