      <h2>Dota 2</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Dota 2</strong> is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed by Valve Corporation, released in 2013. 
        It is the official sequel to the community-made <em>Defense of the Ancients (DotA)</em> mod for Warcraft III. 
        The game is played by two teams of five players each, with the main goal of destroying the enemy’s <strong>Ancient</strong>, a structure located in their base.
      </p>

      <h3>Gameplay</h3>
      <p>
        Dota 2 features over 120 unique heroes, each with different skills and roles such as carry, support, offlane, and midlaner. 
        Matches usually last from 30 to 60 minutes, requiring strategy, teamwork, and precise execution.
      </p>

      <h3>The International (TI)</h3>
      <p>
        One of the most iconic aspects of Dota 2 is its annual world championship, <em>The International</em>. 
        Hosted by Valve, TI is famous for having record-breaking prize pools, often crowdfunded by the community through in-game purchases. 
        For example, <strong>TI10</strong> had a prize pool exceeding <strong>$40 million</strong>, the largest in esports history.
      </p>

      <h3>Professional Scene</h3>
      <p>
        Dota 2 has one of the most competitive and passionate professional scenes. Teams from all over the world—such as OG, Team Secret, and PSG.LGD—compete in regional leagues and major tournaments leading up to The International.
      </p>

      <h3>Community and Culture</h3>
      <p>
        Beyond tournaments, Dota 2 has a strong global community. Fans create content such as guides, fan art, and live streams. 
        The game is also known for its steep learning curve but rewarding gameplay, making it one of the most respected titles in esports.
