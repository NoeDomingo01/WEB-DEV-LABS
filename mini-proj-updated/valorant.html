      <p class="text-justify">
        <strong>Valorant</strong>, developed by Riot Games and released in 2020, is a tactical first-person shooter (FPS)
        that combines precise gunplay with unique agent abilities. Each match typically pits two teams of five players
        against each other in objective-based rounds: attackers attempt to plant and detonate a spike while defenders
        prevent them. Valorant's design intentionally rewards both mechanical skill (aim, recoil control, movement)
        and strategic team play, where agent selection and utility usage are crucial to winning rounds and matches.
      </p>

      <p class="text-justify">
        Since launch, Valorant has rapidly built a structured competitive ecosystem. Riot established the Valorant Champions
        Tour (VCT), regional leagues, and international events to support pro teams and player development. The title's
        esports appeal centers on its blend of tactical depth and the variety of agents — each agent adds a different
        tactical dimension (smokes, flashes, recon tools, area denial, etc.) that teams must coordinate around.

      <h3 class="fw-semibold mt-4">Competitive Scene & Notable Teams</h3>
      <p class="text-justify">
        Valorant's professional scene is fast-growing. Leagues and regional tournaments feed into global events like
        Masters and Champions. Notable organizations and teams that rose quickly in Valorant esports include <em>Sentinels</em>,
        <em>Paper Rex</em>, <em>LOUD</em>, and <em>Fnatic</em>. Players and coaches focus on agent compositions,
        map control, economy management, and precise coordinated executes to outplay opponents on both individual and
        tactical levels.
